#### Abstract
Coma, a state of profound unconsciousness resulting from severe brain injury, presents significant clinical challenges and scientific opportunities. This study investigates the relationship between functional brain states and neurological outcomes in coma patients. Utilizing functional MRI data acquired shortly after injury, we identified distinct whole-brain states characterized by unique patterns of functional connectivity. In comparison to controls, coma patients exhibited a shift towards a less integrated brain state marked by weakened connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and altered inter-regional correlations. Importantly, specific brain state configurations at the acute stage of coma predicted long-term neurological outcomes with high sensitivity and specificity. These findings underscore the potential of functional connectivity metrics as prognostic indicators and highlight the importance of early assessment in guiding clinical interventions and patient care strategies.
